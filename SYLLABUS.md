# Syllabus – Asynchronous server technologies 

## Introduction

This course covers best practices when developing a Web application including API design, package definition, NPM interaction, unit tests and 
transpilers with TypeScript. The objective is to prepare an API which collects metrics to store in a database and provide access through a dashboard.

The course also makes use of usual developer tools : versioning, knowledge bases, transpilers, terminal, ...

## Requirements

This course requires familiarity with JavaScript development and a general knowledge of Web technologies. A reminder is done during the first class to 
assert that everyone has the required basics.

Prior server-side development (ex : Lamp) is a plus.
