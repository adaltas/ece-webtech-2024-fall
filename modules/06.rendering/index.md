# Data Fetching and rendering | with Next.js

## Rendering at Build-time

- Build once, then always service the same file
- Static website
- As fast as it can get
- No state, easy to distribute, eg accross a CDN

## Rendering at Run-time

- Server re-build the page on every request
- Content can be personalized or secured on-demand
- Slower
- Source of error if the generation failed (eg broken database query)

## Re-hydratation

- Page is built at build-time
- Page content is dynamically enriched after the first paint on the client

## CSR - Client-Side Rendering

- Pages are generated at build time
- Content is re-hydrated inside `useEffect`
- Eg: fetch the data from an API

## SSR - Server-Side Rendering

- Page is generated by the server on each request
- Creating a delay
- Not compatible with standard HTTP server and CDN
- Use `getServerSideProps`

## SSG - Static Site Generation

- Similar to CSR
- Page is built from a special function
- Fetch data once when that page builds
- Use `getStaticProps` and eventually `getStaticPaths` for dynamic routes

## ISR â€“ Incremental Static Regeneration

- Combination of SSG, and SSR
- Page is served statically
- Page is rebuilt at certain time and under certain condition
- Use `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` property or the `req.revalidate(path)` function

## Jamstack and CI/CD GitOps demo

Illustration of a Jamstack architecture and a CI/CD GitOps publishing pipeline with the [CSV project](https://csv.js.org).

- Data is stored in a Git repository
- Developers as well as public users may propose updates
- Leverage the GitOps flow on GitHub with pull request (PR)
- GitHub actions build the site for every commit landing on the master branch
- Build is pushed to a particular branch
- Branch is served by GitHub pages
- DNS is managed by [JS.ORG](https://js.org/) with the `CNAME` file
- Takes about 5mn from submission to publication
- The all pipeline is 100% free
